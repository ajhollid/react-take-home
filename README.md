## Assignment Instructions

Your goal is to write a reusable, modular component that displays some data that is fetched from a server.

This `DisplayComponent` should have two variants, one that displays data horizontally, one that displays data vertically.

How you display the data is entirely up to you.

Please follow React best practices, use hooks where it makes sense, comment liberally, etc.

Commits are free so commit early and often!
